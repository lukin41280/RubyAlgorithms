# Fixed Array Challenge

Implement and write RSpec tests for the FixedArray class. The class must conform to the following interface:

Interface

1) FixedArray#new(size): Instantiate a new FixedArray with space for size elements.
2) FixedArray#get(index): Get a value from the array at the specified index. Throw an OutOFBoundsException if the user tries to get a value at an index outside the bounds of the fixed array.
3) FixedArray#set(index, element): Set a value in the array at a specific index and return the element. Throw an OutOFBoundsException if the user tries to set a value at an index outside the bounds of the fixed array.
